    narrator "It's a drizzly Tuesday afternoon in March 2025."

    narrator "Gary Sputnik stands in his backyard holding a shoebox that smells like a fish tank that's been unplugged for three days."

    narrator "Inside lies Mr. Bubbles, his loyal goldfish companion of exactly three years, two months, and sixteen days."

    thoughts "You were probably the best roommate I ever had, Mr. Bubbles."

    thoughts "Never left dirty dishes in the sink, never brought weird dates home..."

    narrator "Gary adjusts his thick-rimmed glasses and hefts the borrowed shovel."

    gary "Okay, buddy. Time for your final journey."

    narrator "The March rain has turned his modest backyard into a small swamp. The soil is soft—good for digging, bad for clean jeans."

    narrator "He's chosen a spot behind the garden shed. Partly because it seems dignified, partly because his landlord specifically said 'no permanent modifications to the landscape.'"

    narrator "The first few shovelfuls go smoothly."

    narrator "Gary isn't exactly athletic—his exercise routine consists mainly of walking to the kitchen for energy drinks."

    narrator "But digging a hole for a goldfish isn't exactly Olympic-level exertion."

    narrator "He's about two feet down when the shovel hits something that definitely isn't dirt."

    play sound "audio/sfx/metallic_clang.ogg"

    narrator "The sound is wrong—not the dull thunk of hitting rock, but a sharp metallic clang that rings out across the yard like a bell."

    gary "What the hell?"

    narrator "He kneels in the mud, brushing away the wet earth with his hands."

    narrator "Whatever he's hit is smooth and artificial. Rectangular, maybe the size of a briefcase."

    narrator "Made from some kind of dark metal that seems to absorb the gray afternoon light rather than reflect it."

    narrator "The surface is covered with symbols—not quite mathematical, not quite pictographic, but somehow familiar in a way that makes the back of his brain itch."

    gary "Okay. This is either really fascinating or really concerning."

    narrator "He spends twenty minutes digging around the edges, getting progressively muddier and more excited."

    narrator "By the time he works the box free, Gary looks like he's been wrestling with the earth itself."

    narrator "He carries the mysterious container inside, leaving muddy footprints across his kitchen floor."

    narrator "In the artificial light, the symbols seem even more intricate, spiraling inward toward a central design."

    gary "Okay, let's say you're right. Why would someone bury a time machine in my backyard?"

    aria "The device appears to be quite old—the metal shows signs of long-term exposure to soil conditions."

    aria "It's possible it was hidden here long before you moved in. Perhaps by someone who wanted to keep it safe."

    gary "So how do I open it?"

    aria "You need to press the symbols in a specific sequence while maintaining a particular resonant frequency."

    aria "Essentially, humming a specific tone. 440 hertz—that's an A note."

    show gary modern worried

    gary "You want me to hum at a box?"

    narrator "Gary feels ridiculous, but he's come this far."

    narrator "Following ARIA's instructions, he presses a series of symbols while humming what he hopes is the right note."

    play sound "audio/sfx/box_opening.ogg"

    narrator "There's a soft hiss, like air being released from a pressurized container."

    narrator "And the top of the box simply... opens. Not hinged or slid, but flows like liquid metal."

    show gary modern excited

    gary "Holy shit."

    narrator "Inside, the box is lined with silver fabric that absorbs light rather than reflects it."

    narrator "Nestled in the center is a single device—like someone crossed a smartphone with a TV remote, decorated with those same mysterious symbols."

    gary "Now what?"

    aria "The interface appears to be intuitive. The large red button is almost certainly the activation control."

    aria "The smaller buttons seem to control temporal and spatial coordinates."

    narrator "Gary examines the device more closely. It's surprisingly light. The symbols on the buttons glow faintly with their own internal light."

    show gary modern neutral

    gary "ARIA, if this thing actually works... where would you go? I mean, when would you go?"

    aria "That's a fascinating question, Gary. There are so many possibilities to consider..."
