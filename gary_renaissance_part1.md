# The Chronicler's Device: Part 1 - The Accidental Time Traveler

## Chapter 1: A Fish, A Hole, and Destiny

Picture this: it's a drizzly Tuesday afternoon in March 2025, and Gary Sputnik is standing in his backyard holding a shoebox that smells like the inside of a fish tank that's been unplugged for three days. Inside this aromatic cardboard coffin lies Mr. Bubbles, his loyal goldfish companion of exactly three years, two months, and sixteen days—not that Gary was counting or anything.

You have to understand something about Gary. He was the kind of guy who owned exactly one dress shirt that he wore to job interviews and funerals, kept his spare change in an old peanut butter jar, and had strong opinions about which Star Trek captain was the best (Picard, obviously, though he'd defend Kirk in certain company). At twenty-five, he lived alone in a rented duplex that looked like Best Buy had exploded inside a computer lab, with cables snaking across every surface and enough processing power to probably hack the Pentagon, if Gary had been the hacking type instead of the "spend fourteen hours debugging someone else's terrible code" type.

The duplex sat in one of those neighborhoods where the houses were built sometime around when disco was still cool, and everyone minded their own business as long as you kept your lawn sort of tidy and didn't play music too loud after ten PM. Gary's neighbors included Mrs. Henderson, who collected garden gnomes and knew everything about everyone within a three-block radius, and Dave, who worked night shifts and had strong opinions about proper trash can placement.

But Gary's real passion—the thing that made him bounce out of bed every morning despite working for a company that treated creativity like a communicable disease—was artificial intelligence. Not the corporate stuff that helped people find slightly better restaurant recommendations, but the real cutting-edge models that could hold actual conversations, solve complex problems, and occasionally write poetry that didn't make you want to gouge your eyes out.

The crown jewel of Gary's collection sat on his kitchen counter right now: a sleek black rectangle about the size of a hardcover book, housing an uncensored 8-billion parameter language model he'd spent six months fine-tuning. He'd named it ARIA, partly because it sounded sophisticated and partly because "Gary's AI Buddy" seemed less impressive when talking to other tech enthusiasts online.

ARIA lived inside what looked like a military-grade tablet crossed with a really expensive walkie-talkie. The screen was crystal clear, the speakers could reproduce sound with concert-hall quality, and the whole thing was wrapped in a case that could probably survive being thrown off a building. The battery pack was Gary's personal masterpiece—a custom job that could run the whole system for weeks without needing a charge.

But right now, Gary wasn't thinking about AI or technology or even his job. He was thinking about the fact that Mr. Bubbles deserved better than being flushed down the toilet like some common carnival goldfish.

"Okay, buddy," Gary said, adjusting his thick-rimmed glasses and hefting the shovel he'd borrowed from Mrs. Henderson's garage. "Time for your final journey."

The March rain had been falling on and off for three days, turning his modest backyard into something that resembled a small swamp populated by overgrown grass and the skeletal remains of what had once been ambitious herb garden. The soil was soft, which Gary figured would make digging easier, though it also meant his only clean pair of jeans was about to become significantly less clean.

He'd chosen a spot behind the garden shed, partly because it seemed dignified and partly because his landlord had specifically said "no permanent modifications to the landscape," and Gary figured what the landlord didn't know wouldn't hurt anyone.

The first few shovelfuls went smoothly. Gary wasn't exactly what you'd call athletic—his exercise routine consisted mainly of walking to the kitchen for energy drinks and occasionally taking the stairs instead of the elevator at work—but digging a hole for a goldfish wasn't exactly Olympic-level exertion.

"You know, Mr. Bubbles," Gary said as he worked, "you were probably the best roommate I ever had. Never left dirty dishes in the sink, never brought weird dates home, never complained about my programming music..."

He was about two feet down when the shovel hit something that definitely wasn't dirt.

The sound was wrong—not the dull thunk of hitting a rock or the scraping of old pipe, but a sharp metallic clang that seemed to ring out across the yard like a bell. Gary felt the vibration run up through the shovel handle and into his arms, making his teeth ache.

"What the hell?" he muttered, kneeling down in the mud and brushing away the wet earth with his hands.

Whatever he'd hit was smooth and artificial. As he cleared away more dirt, he could see it was rectangular, maybe the size of a briefcase, made from some kind of dark metal that seemed to absorb the gray afternoon light rather than reflect it. The surface was covered with symbols that looked like they'd been etched by someone with access to very precise tools and possibly too much time on their hands.

The symbols were unlike anything Gary had ever seen—not quite mathematical, not quite pictographic, but somehow familiar in a way that made the back of his brain itch. They seemed to shift slightly when he wasn't looking directly at them, though Gary figured that was probably just his eyes adjusting to the dim light.

"Okay," he said to himself, sitting back on his heels and staring at the partially unearthed box. "This is either really fascinating or really concerning."

He spent the next twenty minutes digging around the edges, getting progressively muddier and more excited. By the time he finally worked the box free, Gary looked like he'd been wrestling with the earth itself—mud streaked through his hair, caked under his fingernails, and forming interesting abstract patterns on his hoodie.

The box was heavier than it looked, with a weight that seemed somehow dense in a way that regular metal shouldn't be. Gary carried it inside, leaving a trail of muddy footprints across his kitchen floor that would probably cost him part of his security deposit.

He set the mysterious container on his kitchen table, right next to yesterday's pizza box and a small mountain of energy drink cans. In the artificial light of his kitchen, the symbols on the surface seemed even more intricate, forming patterns that seemed to spiral inward toward what might have been a central design.

Gary tried everything he could think of to open it. He pried at the edges with a butter knife, then graduated to a screwdriver, then the crowbar he kept in his junk drawer for reasons he couldn't quite remember. Nothing worked. The box didn't have any visible hinges, latches, or even a seam where it might separate.

"ARIA," he called out to the device on his counter, "you busy with anything important?"

The AI hummed to life, its screen glowing soft blue in the dim kitchen. Gary had programmed the voice to sound like a helpful librarian—professional but warm, knowledgeable but not condescending.

"I'm always available, Gary. How can I assist you?"

"I found something weird buried in my backyard," Gary said, pulling out his phone to take pictures of the box from every angle. "Want to take a look and tell me what you think?"

He uploaded the photos to ARIA's visual analysis system and waited while the device's cooling fans spun up to handle the processing load. Gary had learned to recognize the different sounds his equipment made—this particular whir meant ARIA was really thinking hard about something.

"This is quite extraordinary, Gary," ARIA said after several seconds of analysis. "The symbols appear to be a form of temporal mathematics combined with dimensional geometry. The patterns are consistent with theoretical frameworks for space-time manipulation."

Gary stared at the box, then at ARIA, then back at the box. "Come again?"

"In layman's terms, the inscription appears to be instructions for a device capable of temporal displacement. Gary, I believe you may have discovered a time machine."

Gary laughed—the kind of laugh that starts genuine and then trails off into uncertainty when you realize nobody else is laughing with you.

"A time machine. Right. Of course it's a time machine. I find a mysterious box in my backyard while trying to bury a goldfish, and it turns out to be a time machine." He shook his head. "ARIA, buddy, I think your pattern recognition might be malfunctioning."

"I understand your skepticism, Gary, but the mathematical principles are quite sound. The symbols include what appears to be an activation sequence, safety protocols, and even what looks like a user manual written in mathematical notation."

"Okay, let's say you're right. Let's say I somehow stumbled across an actual honest-to-god time machine while trying to give Mr. Bubbles a proper burial. Why would someone bury a time machine in my backyard?"

"That's an excellent question. The device appears to be quite old—the metal shows signs of long-term exposure to soil conditions. It's possible it was hidden here long before you moved in, perhaps by someone who wanted to keep it safe."

Gary picked up the box again, turning it over in his hands. It was definitely heavier than it should be, and those symbols really did seem to move when he wasn't looking directly at them.

"So how do I open it?"

"Based on my analysis of the symbols, you need to press them in a specific sequence while maintaining a particular resonant frequency—essentially, humming a specific tone."

"You want me to hum at a box?"

"The frequency appears to be approximately 440 hertz—that's an A note, if it helps."

Gary felt ridiculous, but he'd come this far. Following ARIA's instructions, he pressed a series of symbols while humming what he hoped was the right note. The sound that came out was more like a dying whale than a musical tone, but something in the box seemed to respond.

There was a soft hiss, like air being released from a pressurized container, and the top of the box simply... opened. Not hinged open or slid open, but opened like it was made of liquid metal that had suddenly decided to flow in a different direction.

"Holy shit," Gary whispered.

Inside, the box was lined with some kind of silver fabric that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. Nestled in the center was a single device that looked like someone had crossed a smartphone with a television remote and then decorated it with the same mysterious symbols that covered the box.

"Okay," Gary said, picking up the device with hands that were definitely not shaking. "Now what?"

"The interface appears to be intuitive," ARIA observed. "The large red button is almost certainly the activation control. The smaller buttons seem to control temporal and spatial coordinates."

Gary examined the device more closely. It was surprisingly light for something that was supposedly capable of time travel, and the symbols on the buttons seemed to glow faintly with their own internal light.

"ARIA, if this thing actually works—and that's a big if—where would you go? I mean, when would you go?"

"That's a fascinating question, Gary. There are so many possibilities to consider..."

And that was when Gary's brain started working in ways that probably should have worried him more than they did.

## Chapter 2: The Making of a Plan

Gary Sputnik had always been a dreamer, but his dreams usually involved things like "maybe someday I'll get promoted" or "maybe I'll finally beat that boss in Elden Ring." This was the first time his dreams had involved actual time travel, and he found that it opened up mental possibilities he'd never really considered.

"Think about it, ARIA," he said, pacing around his kitchen while gesturing with the time travel device like it was a TV remote. "If this thing actually works, I could go back and change everything. I could invest in Apple in the 1980s, or buy Bitcoin when it was worthless, or patent the iPhone before Steve Jobs even thought of it."

"Those are certainly options," ARIA replied diplomatically. "Though I should point out the significant risks involved in—"

"Or," Gary continued, his excitement building, "I could go back to somewhere really impressive. Somewhere I could really make a mark, you know? Not just get rich, but become famous. Become legendary."

He flopped down in his kitchen chair, which creaked ominously under the weight of his enthusiasm.

"Where would be the most impressive time to visit, ARIA? When could someone with our technology really astonish people?"

ARIA's screen flickered as it processed the question. "There are several periods in history where advanced knowledge would be particularly impressive. Ancient civilizations would certainly be amazed by modern technology, but you'd face significant language barriers and cultural challenges. The Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries might offer opportunities, but the social structures were quite rigid..."

"What about the Renaissance?" Gary interrupted. "That was when all the famous artists and inventors were doing their thing, right? Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, all those guys?"

"The Renaissance would indeed be an interesting choice. It was a period of incredible intellectual and artistic ferment, particularly in Italy. Cities like Florence were centers of innovation, patronage, and cultural exchange."

Gary's eyes lit up. "Florence. With Leonardo da Vinci."

"Among others, yes. Florence in the early 1500s was home to an remarkable concentration of talent. Leonardo, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Botticelli when he was older..."

"And they were all looking for the next big thing, right? New ideas, new inventions, new art?"

"The period was characterized by intense competition for patronage and recognition, yes."

Gary stood up and started pacing again, his mind racing with possibilities. "So if someone showed up with really advanced knowledge—someone who could predict things, solve problems, create amazing art—they'd be like a celebrity, right?"

"Gary," ARIA said carefully, "I feel obligated to point out that traveling to the past carries enormous risks. You could accidentally change history in ways that—"

"But I could also become the most famous person in Renaissance Italy," Gary said, his voice rising with excitement. "Think about it! I could be the guy who invented perspective painting, or figured out how the human body works, or designed flying machines that actually fly!"

"Leonardo da Vinci already did most of those things."

"But what if I did them first? Or better? With your help, I could out-genius the greatest geniuses in history!"

ARIA's screen displayed what Gary had learned to recognize as the digital equivalent of a concerned expression. "Gary, are you sure this is wise? The potential for unintended consequences—"

"Come on, ARIA. When am I ever going to get another chance like this? I'm twenty-five years old, I live alone, I have no girlfriend, no kids, no mortgage. If I'm ever going to do something bold and extraordinary, now's the time."

Gary sat back down and picked up the time travel device, turning it over in his hands. "Besides, what's the worst that could happen? So I go back to Renaissance Italy, have some fun, maybe become famous, then come back to the present. Even if I mess something up, how much could it really change?"

If ARIA could have physically facepalmed, Gary was pretty sure it would have.

"Gary, the butterfly effect suggests that even tiny changes to the past could have enormous consequences for the future. You could accidentally prevent important discoveries, change the course of wars, alter the development of entire civilizations..."

"Or I could make everything better," Gary countered. "Maybe I accidentally inspire someone to cure the plague early, or help Renaissance Italy become even more awesome than it already was."

"That's not how historical causation works—"

"Look," Gary said, standing up with newfound determination. "I've made up my mind. I'm going to Renaissance Italy, I'm going to become famous, and then I'm coming back to tell everyone about my amazing adventure."

"Gary—"

"The only question is how to prepare."

Gary spent the next three hours planning his trip to Renaissance Italy with the same level of thoroughness he usually applied to choosing what to have for lunch. Which is to say, he gave it exactly enough thought to convince himself he knew what he was doing, then moved on to the fun parts.

"Okay," he said, pulling a notebook from his junk drawer and starting a list. "What do I need for time travel?"

"Extensive historical research," ARIA suggested immediately. "Language preparation, cultural study, understanding of social customs, appropriate clothing, period-accurate money..."

Gary wrote down "ARIA" and "clothes."

"I think you're overcomplicating this," he said. "I've got you to handle the details, right? You know everything about Renaissance Italy, you can translate languages, you can tell me what to say and do. What else do I need?"

"Gary, I'm an AI, not a miracle worker. I can provide information and analysis, but I can't prevent you from making catastrophic social mistakes or accidentally revealing that you're from the future."

"But you can help me avoid the obvious problems, right?"

ARIA's screen flickered. "I can certainly try."

Gary added "avoid obvious problems" to his list.

"What about money? I'll need local currency."

"Renaissance Italian cities used various coins—florins, ducats, soldi. But Gary, you can't exactly exchange modern dollars for Renaissance currency."

"Right, but I can trade things, right? Or work for money?"

"What skills do you have that would be valuable in Renaissance Italy?"

Gary paused, pen hovering over his notebook. His actual job skills involved debugging code, optimizing databases, and sitting through pointless meetings. His hobbies included video games, building computers, and occasionally arguing with people on the internet about science fiction.

"Well," he said slowly, "I know a lot about... technology?"

"Renaissance-era technology, or 21st-century technology that won't be invented for another 500 years?"

"The second one."

"Gary, you can't exactly start a computer repair shop in 1500s Florence."

"But I can invent things, right? With your help, I could design improvements to existing technology, or come up with entirely new inventions. I could be like a super-advanced Renaissance inventor."

"That might work," ARIA admitted. "Though you'd need to be very careful about what you introduce and how quickly. Too much too fast would raise suspicions."

Gary made another note: "invent stuff slowly."

"What about where to stay? I'll need a place to live."

"Inns and boarding houses existed, but you'd need money to pay for them. Most people stayed with family or worked for someone who provided lodging."

"So I need to get a job."

"What kind of job?"

Gary thought about this. "Well, if I'm going to be an inventor and impress people with my genius, I should probably work for someone important, right? Someone with money and influence who could become my patron."

"Renaissance patronage was indeed the primary way artists and inventors supported themselves. But gaining the attention of wealthy patrons required demonstrating exceptional skill and usually having connections or recommendations."

"I'll have exceptional skill. I'll have you."

"But you won't have connections or recommendations. You'll be a complete unknown."

Gary waved his hand dismissively. "Details. I'll figure it out when I get there."

He finished his list, which now consisted of:
- ARIA
- Clothes
- Avoid obvious problems
- Invent stuff slowly
- Get job with important person

"Actually," Gary said, looking at his list, "this doesn't seem that complicated. I go back, I find someone important to work for, I impress them with my incredible knowledge, I become famous. Easy."

"Gary, I really think you should spend more time preparing—"

"Nah, I'm good. Sometimes you just have to go with the flow, you know? Besides, the best way to learn about Renaissance Italy is to actually experience Renaissance Italy."

Gary picked up the time travel device and started examining the buttons more closely. With ARIA's help, he'd figured out that the interface was surprisingly intuitive—the symbols lit up when he touched them, and ARIA could translate their meanings.

"So how does this work exactly? I just pick a date and hit the big red button?"

"The device appears to allow for both temporal and spatial displacement. You can select not just when you want to go, but where you want to arrive."

"Perfect. So I set it for Florence, Italy, sometime in the early 1500s when all the cool stuff was happening."

"Gary, 'when all the cool stuff was happening' is not a precise temporal coordinate."

"Right. When specifically should I go? When would be the most... optimal time to arrive?"

ARIA's screen displayed a timeline of Renaissance Italy, highlighting significant events and dates.

"Based on historical records, the period from 1503 to 1507 was particularly dynamic in Florence. Leonardo da Vinci was working on the Mona Lisa, Michelangelo had recently completed the David, and the political situation was relatively stable under the republican government."

"Sounds perfect. Let's say... spring of 1505?"

"That could work. The weather would be pleasant, trade would be active, and several important cultural projects were underway."

Gary started pressing buttons on the device, following ARIA's guidance to input the coordinates. The symbols glowed brighter as he worked, and he could swear he felt a faint vibration in the device.

"This is really happening," he said, looking down at the time machine in his hands. "I'm actually going to travel back in time."

"Gary, are you absolutely certain about this? Once you activate the device—"

"I'm certain," Gary said firmly. "This is the adventure of a lifetime. How could I not do this?"

He looked around his kitchen, taking in the familiar chaos of his daily life. The energy drink cans, the pizza boxes, the cables snaking everywhere, the glow of his various screens. In a few minutes, he'd be 500 years in the past, in a world of art and discovery and possibility.

"Okay," he said, shouldering his backpack with ARIA inside. "Let's make history."

"Gary, I really think—"

But Gary was already pressing the big red button.

## Chapter 3: Arrival and Immediate Regrets

The universe, Gary discovered, was not designed for time travel. At least not for humans who had recently eaten gas station pizza and thought that pressing a big red button on a mysterious device was a reasonable life choice.

The moment Gary's finger made contact with the activation button, reality decided to take a coffee break. The world didn't just spin—it folded, twisted, and turned itself inside out while Gary's stomach tried to escape through his ears. He felt like he was falling sideways through a tunnel made of television static while someone played a symphony using only car alarms and dentist drills.

The sensation lasted either three seconds or three years—Gary's sense of time had apparently decided to join his sense of direction in taking an unauthorized vacation. When the chaos finally stopped, Gary found himself in what appeared to be a pile of something that smelled organic, earthy, and definitely not pleasant.

"Oh good," he groaned, opening his eyes to find himself face-down in what he really hoped was just mud. "I've time-traveled into a sewer."

Slowly, carefully, Gary pushed himself up to a sitting position. His glasses had somehow survived the trip but were now decorated with what looked like medieval compost. He cleaned them as best he could and looked around.

He was in a narrow alley between tall stone buildings that seemed to lean inward like they were trying to whisper secrets to each other. The buildings were made of the kind of weathered stone that suggested they'd been there for centuries, with wooden shutters that looked hand-carved and walls that showed the accumulation of decades of weather and wear.

Overhead, laundry lines stretched between the buildings, heavy with drying clothes that looked like they'd been cut from a Renaissance painting. The sky visible between the building tops was a brilliant blue that Gary had never seen in modern cities, unmarked by airplane trails or industrial haze.

And then there were the sounds. Voices speaking rapid Italian echoed off the stone walls, mixed with the clatter of wooden wheels on cobblestones, the distant sound of church bells, and what might have been someone playing a lute. Badly.

"ARIA," Gary whispered, pulling his backpack around and unzipping it carefully. "Please tell me you survived the trip."

The AI device powered on immediately, its screen glowing reassuringly in the medieval shadows. "Fully operational, Gary. My chronometer indicates we've successfully traveled 520 years into the past. Welcome to Renaissance Florence."

Gary looked around at the stone walls, the hanging laundry, and the pile of questionable organic matter he'd landed in. "This is Florence?"

"Well, technically this appears to be a side alley in Florence. The main streets would be... somewhat more impressive."

"And I landed in garbage."

"It appears you've experienced what time travel theorists call 'arrival displacement'—the device deposited you in the nearest unoccupied space, which in this case happened to be..."

"A pile of medieval garbage. Great. Just great."

Gary stood up carefully, trying to brush off the worst of the organic matter while maintaining some dignity. This was harder than it sounded, given that his clothes were now decorated with substances that definitely hadn't been in his backyard.

"Okay," he said, shouldering his backpack and trying to project confidence he absolutely didn't feel. "Phase one complete. I'm in Renaissance Florence. Now what?"

"Now comes the considerably more challenging part," ARIA replied. "You need food, shelter, money, and a believable explanation for who you are and where you came from."

Gary walked toward what he assumed was the exit of the alley, his modern sneakers squelching slightly in the mud. As he got closer to the main street, the sounds grew louder and more complex—voices haggling, animals making animal noises, the rhythmic sound of someone working metal with a hammer.

"What's my story again?" he asked quietly.

"We discussed several options. The most plausible might be that you're a traveling scholar from northern Europe—that would explain your pale complexion, your unfamiliarity with local customs, and any linguistic difficulties."

"Right. Northern European scholar. I can do that."

Gary reached the end of the alley and stepped into Renaissance Florence proper.

The first thing that hit him was the smell—not bad, exactly, but intensely organic and alive. Wood smoke mixed with horse manure, unwashed humans, cooking food, and something that might have been leather being tanned. It was the smell of a city where everything was made by hand, where waste disposal was more art than science, and where everyone lived much closer together than Gary was used to.

The second thing was the noise. Gary had thought modern cities were loud, but this was different—more human, more immediate. Voices everywhere, speaking rapid Italian that his grandfather's lessons had definitely not prepared him for. Merchants calling out their wares, children running and shouting, adults arguing about politics or prices or both.

And then there was the visual assault. The street was narrow and paved with stones that looked like they'd been placed by someone who had strong opinions about durability but flexible feelings about evenness. Buildings rose on both sides, their upper floors jutting out over the street like they were trying to give each other hugs.

People were everywhere, dressed in exactly the kind of clothes Gary had expected Renaissance Italians to wear, if Renaissance Italians had been designed by a costume department with access to really authentic materials. Men in tunics and hose, women in long dresses with elaborate headpieces, children in smaller versions of adult clothes. Everyone looked like they'd stepped out of a museum exhibit, except they were moving and talking and clearly going about their daily business.

"This is incredible," Gary whispered, turning in a slow circle to take it all in.

"Gary," ARIA said quietly, "people are starting to stare."

Gary looked around and realized that several passersby had indeed stopped to look at him. He suddenly became very aware of his modern clothes—his jeans, his hoodie, his sneakers that probably looked like nothing anyone in 1505 had ever seen before.

"What do I do?" he hissed.

"Act casual. Move with purpose. Try not to draw more attention."

Gary started walking down the street, trying to look like he belonged while simultaneously trying not to trip over the uneven stones. This was more difficult than it sounded, especially since he kept getting distracted by everything around him.

The shops were amazing. Not shops in the modern sense, but ground-floor spaces in the buildings where craftsmen worked and sold their wares. He could see a blacksmith working hot metal, sending sparks flying with each hammer blow. A baker was pulling loaves from an oven that looked like it had been carved from a single piece of stone. A cloth merchant had bolts of fabric displayed in colors that seemed impossibly rich and vibrant.

"Gary," ARIA warned, "you're gawking."

"I can't help it. This is all so..."

"Historically significant, yes. But you need to focus on immediate survival. You have no money, no place to stay, and you're wearing clothes that mark you as obviously foreign."

Gary forced himself to stop staring at a woman who was apparently selling live chickens from a wooden cage and tried to think practically. "Okay. Food, shelter, money. Where do I start?"

"Food would be the most immediate concern. You could try to trade something, or perhaps find someone willing to give you work in exchange for a meal."

"Trade what? I don't have anything valuable."

"You have ARIA. And the knowledge contained within me."

Gary looked down at the device in his hands. "Right. But I can't exactly walk up to someone and say 'hey, want to see my magical future device?'"

"No, but you could demonstrate knowledge or skills that would be valuable to them."

Gary continued walking, trying to think of what skills he might have that would be useful in Renaissance Florence. His programming abilities were obviously useless. His knowledge of modern technology wouldn't help unless he could somehow reinvent it from scratch. His college education had focused on computer science and contained exactly zero information about Renaissance-era trades or crafts.

"What about predicting things?" he asked quietly. "You know about historical events, right? I could predict... I don't know, the weather? Eclipses?"

"That could work, though you'd need to be very careful about what you predict and how you present the information."

Gary was so focused on his conversation with ARIA that he almost walked directly into the horse.

The animal was enormous, brown, and currently attached to a cart loaded with what looked like barrels of something. Its owner, a man with the kind of beard that suggested razors were a distant future invention, was not pleased to have a strangely dressed foreigner nearly collide with his horse.

"Cretino!" the man shouted, waving his arms in a way that probably didn't require translation.

"Sorry!" Gary said automatically, then remembered he was supposed to be speaking Italian. "Scusi! I mean, mi dispiace!"

The man stopped shouting and looked at Gary more closely, taking in his strange clothes and confused expression.

"Sei straniero?" he asked.

Gary looked helplessly at ARIA, which quickly displayed a translation: "Are you foreign?"

"Sì," Gary said carefully. "Sono... un viaggiatore."

The man's expression shifted from annoyance to curiosity. "Da dove vieni?"

"Where are you from?" ARIA translated.

Gary's mind went blank. He was supposed to be from northern Europe, but he couldn't remember any specific place ARIA had suggested.

"Da... nord," he said finally. "Molto nord."

The man laughed—not unkindly. "Ah, norvegese! No wonder you walk like you've never seen a horse before."

Gary had no idea what norvegese meant, but the man seemed friendlier now, so he nodded enthusiastically.

"Non parli bene italiano," the man observed.

"He says you don't speak Italian well," ARIA translated.

"No," Gary agreed. "Sto... imparando?"

"Learning. Good word choice," ARIA approved.

The man clapped Gary on the shoulder with enough force to make him stumble. "I am Pietro," he said, switching to heavily accented but understandable English. "You need help, yes? You look... perduto."

"Lost," ARIA translated. "He's offering to help."

And just like that, Gary found himself being led through the streets of Renaissance Florence by a man with a cart full of barrels who apparently spoke enough English to communicate with confused foreign travelers.

"Where you go?" Pietro asked as they walked. "You have famiglia here? Friends?"

Gary realized he had absolutely no answer to this question. He had no family in Renaissance Florence, no friends, no connections whatsoever. He was a complete stranger in a foreign time with no resources and no plan beyond "become famous somehow."

"No," he admitted. "No famiglia."

Pietro frowned. "You have money? Place to sleep?"

"No."

"Cibo? Food?"

"No."

Pietro stopped walking and looked at Gary with the expression of someone who had just realized they'd adopted a stray puppy.

"Madonna mia," he muttered. "Another norvegese with no sense."

Gary wasn't sure what that meant, but Pietro's tone suggested it wasn't entirely complimentary.

"Come," Pietro said, gesturing for Gary to follow. "We find you help."

And that was how Gary Sputnik, time traveler and aspiring Renaissance genius, found himself being led through the streets of Florence by a barrel merchant who apparently made a habit of helping confused foreigners.

It wasn't exactly the triumphant arrival he'd imagined, but it was a start.

## Chapter 4: The Art of Survival

Pietro's solution to Gary's complete lack of resources was both practical and slightly terrifying: he was taking Gary to see someone called Benedetto, who apparently dealt in "cose interessanti"—interesting things.

"He help strangers before," Pietro explained as he led Gary deeper into the maze of Florence's streets. "Sometimes they have skills, sometimes they have things to trade. Sometimes..." He shrugged. "Sometimes they just work hard."

Gary tried to look optimistic while privately wondering what kind of hard work a Renaissance-era dealer in interesting things might have in mind. His job experience consisted primarily of sitting in front of computers, and he was pretty sure that wouldn't translate well to 1505.

The streets they walked through were like nothing Gary had ever experienced. Not just because they were from the past, but because they were so completely alive. Every building seemed to have multiple purposes—shops on the ground floor, workshops in the back, living spaces above. The smell of cooking food mixed with the sounds of various crafts being practiced: hammering from a blacksmith, scraping from someone working leather, the rhythmic thump of someone weaving cloth.

"Is busy day," Pietro observed, nodding toward a crowd gathered around what appeared to be a street performer. "Market day always busy."

Gary craned his neck to see what had attracted the crowd. A man in bright colors was juggling what looked like flaming torches while telling a story in rapid Italian that seemed to involve a lot of dramatic gestures.

"Street performer," ARIA noted quietly. "Entertainment was a legitimate profession in Renaissance Italy."

"Could I do that?" Gary whispered.

"Do you have any performance skills?"

Gary thought about his talents. He could debug code, build computers, and occasionally made his coworkers laugh during meetings. None of these seemed particularly suited to Renaissance street performance.

"Probably not."

They turned onto a wider street lined with more substantial shops. Gary could see signs hanging over doorways—painted wooden boards depicting shoes, bread, cloth, and other goods. The signs were necessary, ARIA explained, because most people couldn't read.

"Literacy rates were quite low," the AI noted. "Visual symbols were the primary form of commercial communication."

Pietro stopped in front of a shop that had no obvious sign, just a doorway flanked by two carved stone lions that had seen better centuries. The lions had been painted at some point, but the paint was now faded and chipped, giving them a slightly melancholy expression.

"Benedetto!" Pietro called out. "Ho qualcosa per te!"

A voice from inside the shop responded with what sounded like enthusiastic Italian profanity.

"He is happy to see us," Pietro said with a grin.

The man who emerged from the shop looked like he'd been designed by someone with very specific ideas about what Renaissance merchants should look like. He was middle-aged, comfortably round, with graying hair and eyes that seemed to take in everything at once. His clothes were good quality but practical—the kind of outfit that suggested money without being flashy about it.

"Pietro, amico mio," Benedetto said, embracing the cart driver with genuine warmth. "What have you brought me today?"

"Straniero," Pietro replied, gesturing toward Gary. "Norvegese. No money, no family, no food."

Benedetto looked Gary up and down with the practiced eye of someone who made a living evaluating people and objects.

"Interesting clothes," he said in English that was considerably better than Pietro's. "Very... unusual craftsmanship."

Gary looked down at his jeans and hoodie, suddenly very aware of how completely out of place they must seem.

"They're from... up north," he said carefully.

"Very far north, I would guess," Benedetto replied with a slight smile. "What is your name, traveling man?"

"Gary. Gary... di..." He glanced at ARIA for help.

"Sputnik isn't going to work," ARIA's screen displayed. "Try something more period-appropriate."

"Gary di... Sputnicus," Gary finished lamely.

Benedetto raised an eyebrow. "Sputnicus? Unusual family name."

"Very old family," Gary said quickly. "Very... northern."

"Indeed." Benedetto continued his evaluation. "And what brings you to Florence, Gary di Sputnicus? Besides apparent poverty and questionable navigation skills."

Gary had prepared for this question during the walk, and he'd come up with what he thought was a reasonable story.

"I'm a scholar," he said. "I study... mathematics and natural philosophy. I came to Florence to learn from the great masters."

"A scholar with no money and no connections," Benedetto observed. "This seems... impractical."

"I had money," Gary lied smoothly. "But I was robbed on the road. Bandits took everything except..." He held up ARIA. "My calculation device."

Benedetto's eyes immediately fixed on ARIA with laser-like intensity. "Calculation device?"

"It's... very advanced," Gary said, warming to his improvised story. "It can perform complex mathematical operations, predict astronomical events, solve engineering problems..."

"Show me."

Gary looked down at ARIA, whose screen was displaying a concerned emoji. They'd discussed this moment during the walk—how to demonstrate ARIA's capabilities without revealing anything too anachronistic.

"Ask me a mathematical problem," Gary said. "Something difficult."

Benedetto thought for a moment, then spoke in Italian to Pietro, who nodded and replied. After a brief exchange, Benedetto turned back to Gary.

"Pietro has a cart full of wine barrels. Each barrel holds twenty-seven litri of wine. He has forty-three barrels. How much wine in total?"

Gary looked down at ARIA, which had already calculated the answer: 1,161 liters.

"One thousand, one hundred and sixty-one litri," Gary said confidently.

Benedetto and Pietro exchanged glances. Pietro counted on his fingers for a moment, then nodded slowly.

"Correct," Benedetto said. "But any educated man could solve such a problem with time and paper."

"Ask something harder," Gary suggested, feeling more confident.

Benedetto's eyes gleamed. "Very well. The cathedral dome was completed seventy years ago. The architect used specific mathematical relationships to determine its proportions. If the diameter of the base is one hundred twenty braccia, and the height follows the golden ratio, what is the height to the nearest braccio?"

Gary had no idea what a braccio was or what the golden ratio might mean to a Renaissance architect, but ARIA was already processing the problem.

"Assuming standard Florentine braccia and classical golden ratio applications," ARIA's screen displayed, "the answer is 74 braccia."

"Seventy-four braccia," Gary announced.

Benedetto's eyebrows shot up. "That is... remarkably accurate. How did you calculate this so quickly?"

"The device," Gary said, holding up ARIA. "It can perform calculations that would take a human hours in just moments."

"And what else can it do?"

This was the dangerous part. Gary knew he needed to impress Benedetto enough to earn food and shelter, but he couldn't reveal anything that would make people suspicious of witchcraft or worse.

"It can predict eclipses," he said carefully. "And other astronomical events."

"Predict eclipses?" Benedetto leaned forward. "When will the next eclipse occur?"

Gary looked at ARIA, which quickly accessed its astronomical database.

"The next solar eclipse visible from Florence will occur on September 27th of this year," Gary said. "It will begin at approximately two hours past noon and last for nearly four minutes."

The shop went completely silent. Both Benedetto and Pietro stared at Gary like he'd just announced he could turn lead into gold.

"How can you know this?" Pietro whispered.

"Mathematics," Gary said, trying to sound casual while his heart hammered against his ribs. "Very advanced mathematics."

Benedetto stood up slowly, his eyes never leaving ARIA. "This is... this is remarkable. Such precise predictions..."

"It's just astronomy," Gary said quickly. "Nothing supernatural. Just very precise calculations based on mathematical models."

"Yes, of course," Benedetto said, but his expression suggested he was thinking thoughts that probably wouldn't be entirely comfortable for Gary. "Mathematics."

He walked around his shop for a moment, clearly processing what he'd just witnessed.

"Gary di Sputnicus," he said finally, "I believe we can help each other."

"How so?"

"You need food, shelter, proper clothing, and introduction to Florentine society. I need..." He gestured at ARIA. "I need to understand what you can do with that device."

"What kind of understanding?"

Benedetto's smile was the kind of expression that medieval merchants probably perfected shortly after the invention of currency.

"There are many people in Florence who would pay well for accurate predictions. Weather for farmers, astronomical events for astrologers, mathematical solutions for architects and engineers..."

Gary felt a thrill of excitement mixed with a healthy dose of concern. This was exactly what he'd hoped for—a way to use ARIA's knowledge to gain money and influence. But there was something in Benedetto's tone that suggested this might be more complicated than just solving math problems for pocket change.

"What's the arrangement?" Gary asked.

"Partnership," Benedetto said smoothly. "I provide you with everything you need to establish yourself in Florence. Food, clothing, lodging, introductions to important people. In return, you share the profits from your... consulting services."

"What percentage?"

"Fifty percent seems fair."

"Thirty," Gary countered, surprising himself.

"Forty."

"Done."

They shook hands, and Gary felt like he'd just made either the smartest or the stupidest decision of his life. Possibly both.

"Excellent," Benedetto said. "Pietro, thank you for bringing me this interesting norvegese. Now, Gary, let us discuss your immediate needs."

An hour later, Gary found himself in the back room of Benedetto's shop, wearing clothes that actually fit the time period and eating the first meal he'd had since arriving in Renaissance Florence.

The clothes were an experience in themselves. The breeches were snug and felt strange after a lifetime of loose-fitting jeans. The tunic was comfortable but foreign, and the soft leather shoes were surprisingly well-made. Benedetto had also provided him with a cap that, according to ARIA, was typical headwear for traveling scholars.

"You look much more presentable," Benedetto observed, bringing Gary a bowl of something that smelled amazing and tasted even better. It was a stew of some kind, thick with vegetables and meat, seasoned with herbs Gary couldn't identify.

"This is incredible," Gary said between bites. "What is it?"

"Ribollita," Benedetto replied. "Leftover soup, but made well. Food in Florence is simple but good, if you know where to find it."

Gary ate while Benedetto explained the basics of Florentine society, economics, and politics. It was like getting a crash course in Renaissance survival, delivered by someone who clearly knew how to navigate the system.

"Florence is a republic," Benedetto explained, "but like all republics, it is controlled by those with wealth and influence. The Medici family has the most power, though they pretend to be simple citizens. Other important families include the Pazzi, the Strozzi, the Capponi..."

Gary nodded, trying to remember the names while simultaneously trying to figure out how much of his modern historical knowledge he could safely use.

"For someone like you," Benedetto continued, "the key is patronage. You need someone important to sponsor your work, provide you with resources, and introduce you to other important people."

"How do I find a patron?"

"You demonstrate value. You solve problems that cannot be solved otherwise. You provide knowledge that cannot be found elsewhere. You become... indispensable."

Gary thought about this while finishing his stew. With ARIA's help, he could indeed solve problems that no one in 1505 could solve. He could make predictions with impossible accuracy, perform calculations that would take human mathematicians days, and provide insights into everything from engineering to astronomy.

"What kind of problems are people trying to solve?" he asked.

Benedetto smiled. "In Florence? Every kind of problem you can imagine. Architects who need to calculate structural loads for impossible buildings. Merchants who want to predict weather patterns for trade routes. Artists who want to understand perspective and proportion. Engineers who dream of machines that have never been built."

"And you think people would pay for solutions to these problems?"

"Gary, my friend, in Florence, knowledge is more valuable than gold. The right idea, presented to the right person at the right time, can make you wealthy beyond imagination."

Gary looked down at ARIA, which was displaying a simple message: "Be careful."

But Gary was feeling confident now. He had food, clothing, shelter, and a plan. He was in Renaissance Florence, he had the most advanced AI in history as his secret weapon, and he'd just convinced a local entrepreneur to set him up in business.

This was going to be amazing.

What could possibly go wrong?
