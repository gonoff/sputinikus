## Sound Effects (5 files)

Place in: `game/audio/sfx/`

### 1. metallic_clang.ogg
**Scene:** Gary's backyard, 2025. He's digging in muddy ground and his shovel strikes a buried metal box.
**Description:** A single, resonant metallic clang. The sound of a metal shovel blade hitting a solid metal surface buried in wet earth. Should have a slightly muffled quality (dampened by soil) but still ring with a clear metallic tone. Not a sharp ping, but a heavier clunk with brief resonance.
**Duration:** 0.5-1 second
**Character:** Surprising, attention-grabbing, slightly mysterious

### 2. box_opening.ogg
**Scene:** Gary activates the time machine box using a resonant frequency (humming the correct note while pressing symbols).
**Description:** A mechanical/pneumatic opening sound. Starts with a soft click or pressure release (like breaking an ancient seal), followed by a smooth sliding/opening mechanism. Should feel both mechanical and slightly otherworldly - this is advanced future technology disguised as an antique. Could include a subtle electronic hum or whine underneath.
**Duration:** 1.5-2.5 seconds
**Character:** Mysterious, technological, satisfying

### 3. time_travel.ogg
**Scene:** Used twice - when Gary travels to 1505 Florence, and when he returns to 2025. Reality folds and distorts around him.
**Description:** A complex, layered temporal transition sound. Should convey reality bending/folding. Could include: rising electronic tones, a whooshing/rushing sensation, crystalline chimes or shimmers, subtle bass rumble, and a sense of acceleration then deceleration. The sound should feel like being pulled through dimensions - disorienting but not harsh.
**Duration:** 3-5 seconds
**Character:** Dramatic, sci-fi, reality-warping, slightly dizzying

### 4. horse_neigh.ogg
**Scene:** Gary steps into a Renaissance Florence street and nearly collides with Pietro's horse and cart.
**Description:** A startled horse whinny/neigh. The horse is surprised by someone suddenly stepping in front of it. Should sound authentic to a working cart horse - not a wild stallion scream, but an alarmed snort/neigh from a draft horse. Brief and reactive.
**Duration:** 1-2 seconds
**Character:** Startling, realistic, grounding (contrasts the sci-fi moment before)

### 5. crowd_gasping.ogg
**Scene:** Piazza della Signoria, Florence. A crowd watches as the solar eclipse Gary predicted begins. Mixed reactions of awe and fear.
**Description:** A Renaissance crowd reacting to a supernatural-seeming event. Collective gasp followed by murmuring. Some voices express wonder, others fear. Should sound like dozens of people in an open plaza - outdoor acoustics, mix of male and female voices, perhaps some Italian exclamations ("Dio mio!"). Not screaming - more hushed awe and nervous chatter.
**Duration:** 3-5 seconds
**Character:** Awed, fearful, reverent, builds tension
